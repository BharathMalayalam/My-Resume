            <h2>Project</h2>
            <h4>Applock</h4>
            <p>AppLock is a simple yet effective desktop application developed in Python to restrict unauthorized access
                to specific programs or files on a system. The primary objective of this project is to provide users
                with an additional layer of security for their private or sensitive applications by requiring
                authentication before access is granted.

                The project utilizes Python's tkinter library for building the graphical user interface, and os and
                subprocess modules for managing system-level operations. On launching AppLock, users are greeted with a
                login screen that prompts for a password. Once authenticated, users can add or remove applications they
                want to lock. The list of locked applications is stored in a secure configuration file or database, and
                the system constantly monitors running processes. If a locked application is detected running without
                proper authorization, it is immediately closed or access is denied.

            <h4>Digital Security Service</h4>
            <p>CyberAware is an educational website developed to promote awareness about cybersecurity threats and
                encourage safe digital practices among users. In the digital age, where cybercrimes are increasing
                rapidly, this website aims to educate students, professionals, and the general public on how to protect
                their personal data and stay safe online.

                The website is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and optionally Python
                (Flask/Django) or PHP for backend features. It contains user-friendly sections such as Types of Cyber
                Threats, Online Safety Tips, Strong Password Guidelines, and Safe Social Media Usage. The information is
                presented in a simple and engaging format to make learning accessible to non-technical users.
